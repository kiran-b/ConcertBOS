== ConcertBOS

ConcertBOS is a concert discovery service for the Boston metropolitan area.  It's backed by last.fm's artist information, and is a Ruby on Rails app.

This was made for a User Interfaces class (6.813/6.831) at MIT.  It currently has a fully functional front end, but the backend is mocked up.
